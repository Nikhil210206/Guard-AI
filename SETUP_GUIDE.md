## 📊 Features Explained

### 1. Lip Movement Detection + Audio Analysis
- Detects when user is speaking during exam
- Uses both visual lip movement and audio analysis
- Differentiates between yawning and actual speaking
- Logs start and end times of speaking events

### 2. Gaze Tracking
- Monitors eye and head movement
- Detects when user looks away from screen
- Shows warning after 5 seconds of looking away
- Tracks: Looking Left, Right, Up, Down, Center

### 3. Website Monitoring

- Logs all open tabs every 5 seconds
- Detects unauthorized website access
- Records timestamps of website usage

### 4. Multiple Person Detection (NEW!)
- Detects when more than one face appears on camera
- Immediate warning displayed
- Logs all multiple person incidents
- Helps prevent impersonation and collaboration

## 📁 Generated Files

### Logs Directory (`logs/`)
- `guard_ai_logs.txt` - Detailed system logs with session IDs
- `session_report.txt` - Raw event data for current session
- `final_report.pdf` - Comprehensive PDF report (downloadable)
- `website_usage_logs.txt` - Website monitoring logs

### Reports Include:
1. **Session Information**
   - Unique session ID
   - Start time
   - Report generation time

2. **Website Tracking**
   - All websites/tabs accessed
   - Timestamps

3. **Speaking Events**
   - When user was speaking
   - Duration

4. **Looking Away Events**
   - When user looked away
   - Duration

5. **Multiple Person Detection**
   - When multiple faces detected
   - Number of faces

## ⚙️ Customization

Edit `config.py` to customize detection thresholds:

```python
# Lip Detection
LIP_MOVEMENT_THRESHOLD = 2.5  # Sensitivity
SPEAKING_AUDIO_THRESHOLD = 0.01  # Audio level

# Gaze Tracking
LOOK_AWAY_DURATION = 5  # Seconds before warning

# Multiple Person Detection
MAX_ALLOWED_FACES = 1  # Maximum faces allowed
```

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test suite to verify everything works:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python test_backend.py
```

Expected output:
```
✅ opencv-python imported successfully
✅ mediapipe imported successfully
✅ numpy imported successfully
✅ sounddevice imported successfully
✅ psutil imported successfully
✅ fpdf imported successfully
✅ flask imported successfully
✅ main.py has no syntax errors
✅ app.py has no syntax errors
✅ PDF generation works
🎉 All tests passed! Backend is ready to use.
```

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Camera Permission Error
If you see "Cannot access camera":
1. Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Camera
2. Enable camera access for Terminal/Python

### Microphone Permission Error

2. Enable microphone access for Terminal/Python

### Safari Monitoring Not Working
Make sure Safari is running and has tabs open. The monitoring checks every 5 seconds.

### Report Not Generated
- Make sure you clicked "Stop Guard AI" before downloading
- Check `logs/` directory for `final_report.pdf`
- Review `logs/guard_ai_logs.txt` for errors
